                <p>
                    Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur dominates the skyline of the "Blue City" from its lofty central position
                    on a rugged cliff, where it seems to have sprouted up out of the rock. The fort is one of the most
                    impressive and best preserved forts in India. It has been thoughtfully turned into a superb tourist
                    destination that will delight everyone from photographers to history buffs. The illustrious fort has
                    also featured in the writings of Rudyard Kipling and Aldous Huxley, and was named Best Fortress in
                    Asia by Time magazine in 2007.
                    Mehrangarh Fort is located in the center of Jodhpur, the second largest city in Rajasthan.

                <p>
                    Jaswant Thada is a 19th century royal cenotaph located to the left of the Mehrangarh Fort complex.
                    It was built by Maharaja Sardar Singh to commemorate his father Maharaja Jaswant Singh II, the 33rd
                    Rathore ruler of Jodhpur. A beau ideal of architectural excellence, it is a white marble memorial
                    built out of intricately carved sheets of marble; in fact, the faade seems to shine when hit by
                    sunlight.



                    Today, Jaswant Thada serves as a museum and gallery of sorts, displaying memorabilia, including
                    paintings and portraits of the rulers of Jodhpur, to the public. The grounds of the thada serve as a
                    venue for morning concerts during music festivals such as the Rajasthan International Folk Festival
                    and the World Sacred Spirit Festival, prompting thousands of tourists to flock to the city in search
                    of recreation and musical enlightenment.

                <p>
                    Umaid Bhavan Palace is one of the last constructed places in India. It is hence also popular for it
                    designs and architecture,
                    which is of great attraction to the tourists of Jodhpur. Located within the city premises, this
                    palace is a mirror to the
                    princely era of Jodhpur. Currently, Umaid Bhavan Palace is divided into three areas, one of which is
                    still owned by the royal
                    family of Jodhpur city.Among the other two, one is converted to a heritage hotel which is known for
                    providing a rich royal
                    experience to its visitors; the other is a museum that showcases the art pieces of the royal age.
                    The palace and its
                    surroundings are considered to be brilliantly constructed.
