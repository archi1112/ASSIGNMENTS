        Here is the short story of a
        <i style="color: crimson"> Thirsty Crow with Moral. </i> The story is a
        moral lesson for kids and students. The story on thirsty crow teaches us
        that necessity is the mother of invention. We found how a crow made the
        impossible possible.

        One hot day a thirsty crow, looking for water everywhere. Not a single
        drop of water could he find. After a long search, he found a pot with a
        little water in it. Unfortunately, the pot was huge and the water was
        deep down. There was no way the crow could reach the water.His throat
        was dry and he had to find a way to get to the water. The unfortunate
        crow felt as if he was going to die of thirst.
        <i style="color: crimson">
          “There must be some way that I can reach the water,” he thought. “I
          have to find it.

        As he was desperately looking around, he saw pebbles on the ground. An
        idea struck him. He started picking up the pebbles one by one. Then he
        dropped them into the pot. With each pebble that he dropped, the water
        rose a little higher.After some time, he found that the water had raised
        enough for him to put his beak inside.
        <i style="color: crimson">
          He drank the water to his heart’s content. His thirst quenched, he
          flew away satisfied.
